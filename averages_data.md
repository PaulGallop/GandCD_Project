# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
Holds my coursework for this Coursera Data Science Specialisation Course

## Source Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The project data  represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data for the project is at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The description of the original data set is at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Goal
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Files
* README.md - this file which introduces the repro and explains what files it holds and how they are connected
* CodeBook.md - a description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
* run_analysis.R - this file executes the analysis described in the codebook
* averages_data.txt - the tidy data set obtained from running the run_analysis.R script
